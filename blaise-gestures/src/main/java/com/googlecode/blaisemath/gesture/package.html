        <h1>The Gesture API</h1>
        <p>
            The gesture API provides advanced mouse handling support.
            {@code GestureOrchestrator} maintains a registry of {@code MouseGesture}s,
            allowing clients to intelligently pass along mouse events to appropriate
            gestures.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to receiving mouse events, gestures support a lifecycle
            of activation and use:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gestures are registered with the orchestrator in priority.</li>
            <li>Gestures determine the conditions under which they may be activated.</li>
            <li>Gestures are activated when these conditions are met, and they have priority over other gestures.</li>
            <li>When active, gestures are passed mouse events from the owning component.</li>
            <li>Active gestures may be <i>canceled</i>, which resets their state and inactivates them.</li>
            <li>Active gestures may be <i>finalized</i>, which completes the gesture and takes appropriate action.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>In Practice</h1>
        <p>
            In practice, a {@code LayerUI} is used to setup mouse handling for the
            component owning an orchestrator, using {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.gesture.GestureLayerUI}.
            If there is no active gesture, the set of gestures registered with the orchestrator
            are given the opportunity to "claim" mouse events and activate themselves
            (in order of priority). Once a gesture has been activated, it receives
            all mouse events until it is completed or canceled.
